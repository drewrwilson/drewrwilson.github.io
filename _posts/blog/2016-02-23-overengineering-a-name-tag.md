# Laser cut name tag with vinyl lettering

*I used CAD software to design a name-tag based on our logo and then used an $18,000 laser-cutter and a vinyl cutter to make 7 over-engineered name-tags, so people can find us organizers during the New England VegFest. Below are some photos & notes on how I made these name tags.*

In 2009, I founded [New England VegFest](https://NewEnglandVegFest.com), an annual vegetarian food festival in Worcester, Massachusetts. For 7 years it has been run entirely by volunteers. The organizing team is made up of 7 volunteers who meet weekly for the 8 months leading up to the festival, we recruit exhibitors, sell sponsorships, put up posters, and promote the event. When the day of the festival arrives, each of the 7 members of the organizing team play a crucial role directing the event. We check-in the exhibitors and tell them where to set up, we coordinate volunteers' schedules, manage the cooking demos & speakers, sell merch & books, introduce the speakers, etc, etc. When something goes wrong or when something catches on fire--which happens sometimes--people need to be able to easily find an organizer right away to solve the problem. But we're all volunteers, so it's kind of hard to find an organier versus one the hundred volunteers. Organizers wear a different color shirt so we stick out, but even so people sometimes walk right by one of us when they're looking for help. So I made some name-tags.

Below is a step-by-step guide on how I used a laser-cutter and vinyl cutter to make these nice little name tags.


# Materials:

 * Colored Cardboard - I found some nice scraps of blue cardboard that came from the dumpster at an architect's office
 * Sheet of vinyl sticker paper - I used white
 * Transfer tape - masking tape will do

# Tools

 * Laser cutter - I used an Epilog 30W
 * Vinyl cutter - I used a Roland plotter
 * Exacto knife, tweezers or dental instruments
 * Cutting pad (optional, but real nice)

# Step-by-step notes

The goal for this project is to make a big, bright name tag that stands out. The design of the name tag needs to fit with the rest of the branding of the event. The general idea is to laser cut a fun shape, paste on some vinyl lettering that identify someone as an organizer, and then attach some kind of fastener to the back of it so someone can attach it to their shirt.

## Step 1: Design it

The logo for the event has these four fun vegetable shapes as part of it. For the shape of the nametag, we'll use the tomato from the logo. Hopefully the shape will stick out and subtly communicate a connection with the event's branding and bestow some sense of legitimacy to the person wearing it. Yeah, I have high hopes for this name tag. It's a symbol of power.

**Why the tomato?** Out of the four vegetables in the logo, the tomato has the largest internal area. This provides a little more room to squeeze in some text. The font is Open Sans, which matches the font that we use in other branding for the event.

Here's is the design that I drew in Illustrator:

The plan is to laser cut the shape, cut out the text in vinyl, place the text on the shape and then have an organizer write their name on the name-tag with a marker.

## Step 2: Laser-cut the shape

There are two ways that you can use a laser cutter; You can etch or you can cut. For this design we are only cutting and not doing any etching. Cutting on a laser is uses vectors images, etching can be bitmap images. It's not important to know the difference for the sake of this project, but the key part is that my image needed to be in the format of a vector image. When I exported it from Illustrator I saved the file as an SVG.

The laser that I used for this project uses Corel Draw and the Epilog print driver, so I imported my SVG file. In order for the Epilog print driver to know which lines are intended to be cuts, you need to set the stroke width on your cut lines to "hairline". Select the shape in the design and in the toolbar above, select the stroke width. To keep it simple, I just removed my text from the design since we'll making that on the vinyl machine. I just deleted the text from the file for now.

These are settings that I used to cut the cardboard:

 * **Power:** 25%
 * **Speed:** 75%
 * **Frequency:** 500Hz

After the laser is set up and the file is prepared, it's time to print and run the laser. I ran a couple of test cuts to see what size name tag I wanted. In the end, I decided on aroud 5.5" wide.
