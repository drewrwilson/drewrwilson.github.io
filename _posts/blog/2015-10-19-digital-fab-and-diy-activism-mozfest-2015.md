## Laser-cutting Stencils, Screen-printing, CNC Wood Block Printing

*[MozFest](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/) is Mozilla's huge annual participatory festival & conference about the future of the open web. It's a clusterfuck of creativity, activism and geekiness. This year MozFest is happening on **November 6-8, 2015** in London. Tickets are £45. Below is a quick description of one of two sessions that I'll be running during the festival.*

### Session Description:

High tech manufacturing tools are becoming more accessible for do-it-yourselfers, makers and activists. You can often find lots of tools at local maker spaces that can be used to easily make large quantities of inexpensive activist gear. In this participatory session, you’ll learn about creative ways to create giant banners, laser-cut stencils so you can print your own t-shirts and banners, make custom vinyl stickers, how to use CNC machines to carve wood and other techniques.

### Here's what we'll be doing in this session:
**See Examples DIY Production Techniques:** In the first part of the session you'll see some examples of production & printing techniques that you can use for your own projects & activism. We'll talk about how to get access to maker machines and finding local maker spaces.

**Let's Make Some Prints:** This is the good part. In the second part, we'll get our hands dirty and make some stuff. We'll cut stencils and print some t-shirts, bandanas, patches and posters. We'll have all the inks and materials you'd need, but bring a blank t-shirt to print on. (Don’t worry if you don’t have one with you, we'll also have fabric and paper available.)
