This year at the national animal rights conference, I was on a panel about grassroots activism. Particularly, my topic was about being effective in grassroots activism. Instead of making a laundry list of tactics and ideas for activism, I decided to go a different route. Warning, this talk gets nerdy. It's about comic book superheroes, it involves doing some math, but the ending bit is about being effective as an advocate.

*The presentation was inspired by my friend Duck Osborne who did some funny math about the ethics of comic book heroes.*
