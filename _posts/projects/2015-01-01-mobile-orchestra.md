Mobile Orchestra is a generative music project. It's a way to *"audiolize"* (like visualize, but with audio) a group of people doing something active together. It generates music based on how many people are a participating. The intended audience was cyclists participating in Critical Mass, which is a giant group bike ride.

**How does it work?** One person plugs their phone into a loud speaker or other mobile sound system. Then he or she opens the app and shares a link with other cyclists. When a person joins, a new track is added to the mix, representing their involvement. When a person leaves the group, their soundtrack also leaves.

## Started at a hack day
This was the winning project at the Civic Happiness hackathon in San Francisco. I came up with the idea when I was participating in Critical Mass and wanted to have a fun way to represent data about the ride in loud speaker playing music during the ride. There were 6 people on the team that made this. The hack day was only 8 hours long, so the project started out as a big idea, but we had to carve it down to a minimalist, functioning project by the end of the day. Originally we wanted to use GPS location data to determine the speed, direction, and size of the cyclist group then represent that data with audio and generate music. With the time constraints we had to scale back our ambitions to something smaller. The end product is now something that adds a track to a mix every time someone opens the app and removes the track when they leave.
