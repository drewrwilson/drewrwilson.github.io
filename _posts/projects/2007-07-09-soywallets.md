*wallets made out of recycled soymilk containers*

In 2007, I made a wallet out of recycled soymilk containers. Then I made [a website](http://www.soywallets.com/) where I sold the wallets and show [how to make your own](http://http://www.soywallets.com/diy/).

The project was featured on MAKE magazine's website. For a while I was overwhelmed with the orders and had to collect used soymilk containers from local coffee shops. The buy-it-now button is gone because I don't make these wallets anymore, so if you'd like one you'll just have to follow the DIY guide and make you own.

*Note: Please excuse the dated website. It's from 2007.*

## A fun story
The wallet was [featured on MAKE Magazine's blog](http://makezine.com/2007/07/09/soy-wallets/) and appeared on various DIY and crafter blogs. At one point I got a call from a marketing company representing Silk Soymilk. I was expecting a cease-and-desist order, but was pleasantly surprised when the guy ordered 10 wallets to give as gifts to the soy-execs.

## How can I get one? Can I buy one?
I don't make them anymore, so you can't buy one from me. I do keep the website online because [the howto guide](http://http://www.soywallets.com/diy/) still gets traffic. You can go through the howto guide and make your own.
