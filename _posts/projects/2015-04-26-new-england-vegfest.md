[New England VegFest](https://NewEnglandVegFest.com) is an annual vegetarian food festival with over 10,000 attendees, 140 vendors, and run entirely by volunteers.

I founded [VegWorcester](http://VegWorcester.com) in 2006, the organization that presents the festival. In 2010 I launched the [New England VegFest](https://NewEnglandVegFest.com)  and I remain involved as a lead organizer and president of the non-profit organization.

## April 26, 2015

This year thousands and thousands of attendees filled the convention center in Worcester, MA to sample the best vegetarian and vegan foods from across New England.

This free event is funded through event sponsorship, bake sales, and individual donations. In 2014, the Mayor endorsed the festival and officially proclaimed the following week to be VegWeek. In 2015 Congressman Jim McGovern joined us and pledged to support us in the next year of organizing.
