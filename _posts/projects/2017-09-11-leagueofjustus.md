League of Just Us is a printmaking collective that brings mobile printing to
grassroots social movements. Using screenprinting and stenciling techniques, the League creates spontaneous art spaces at rallies, protests, marches where people are working together to print their own signs, bandanas, flags, banners and ther cultural artifacts. The result is more vibrant and inclusive moments of dissent where people shift from passive attendees into active co-creators of civic culture.
