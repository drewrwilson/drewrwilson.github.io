Mobile Orchestra is a generative music project. It's a way to *"audiolize"* (like visualize, but with audio) a group of people doing something active together. It generates music based on how many people are a participating. The intended audience was cyclists participating in Critical Mass, which is a giant group bike ride.

**How does it work?** One person plugs their phone into a loud speaker or other mobile sound system. Then he or she opens the app and shares a link with other cyclists. When a person joins, a new track is added to the mix, representing their involvement. When a person leaves the group, their soundtrack also leaves.

## Started at a hack day
I came up with the idea while participating in Critical Mass bike ride. We had 6 people on the team that made this during a an 8 hour long "Civic Happiness" hackathon in San Francisco.
