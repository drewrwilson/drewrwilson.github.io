I made a video mashup of an Insane Clown Posse music video for "Juggalo Island" with LFO's "Girls that wear Abercrombie & Fitch". I noticed that even though the music couldn't be more different, both were upbeat summer songs. So I thought it would be fun to play LFO's music over ICP's video and see if I could make it look like ICP was singing this 90's one-hit-wonder.
