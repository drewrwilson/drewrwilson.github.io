*Cute Pets is a twitter bot that shares photos and info about adoptable animals in shelters. Deployed in 21 cities across the US and also in Chemnitz, Germany.*

I started the project after visiting the Denver animal shelter and wondering how to better share info about adoptable animals with potential adopters.

The project has since spread to covering 21 US cities, including Boston, Austin, and San Francisco. It was also translated & redeployed in Chemnitz, Germany.
