## A Literature Tracking System for Newsracks

**leStands** is an app to track literature distributed through free literature stands. Activists & volunteers use the app when restocking a stand. A program administrator can then see a dashboard with statistics and other information about how the stands are performing.

## Designed for The Humane League
leStands is used by The Humane League, a national animal protection non-profit with offices in cities across the US. Humane League advocate for animals who are raised for food. In a handful of cities they have plastic newsracks placed throughout the downtown and each week a volunteer or staff person stock them with magazines. leStands allows their staff to use their smartphone to record how many magazines they added to stands. Then managers can look at overviews and identify trends so that they can make strategic decisions about how often to check the stands, when to relocate stands, and how effective their outreach has been.

## Background
I've managed a literature stands program like this when I lived in DC and briefly when I was in Massachusetts. I believe that they are an effective way to reach a large number of people, but it never feels that way when you're restocking the stands. Sometimes it's raining or snowing and I would trudge out to these stands to find it empty and sometimes covered in graffiti or stickers. You never meet the people who took the magazines and never hear whether or not the magazines had any impact on them. So you fill up the stand and hope people are reading them. I was curious how to optimize this program so started keeping track of how many magazines each stand distributes. At first, it was just a spreadsheet. Some columns for stand name, amount of magazines added, date, etc. I would take a sheet of paper with me and jot down notes about each stand when I went out to check on them: 200 added to the stand outside of Tortilla Sam's, 100 added to the one near Da Lat, etc. By the time I got home, it was pretty common that I would have lost the scrap of paper and couldn't enter it to my spreadsheet. I wanted to use my phone to record these updates, so I made leStands.

## Current Status: Pilot version in Charlotte
leStands is currently being tested in Charlotte, NC with 35 stands. We're gathering feedback and data on the application to see if it's something that could be useful in other places as well.
